# Computer-Vision-Automatic-Tracking

--> "Computer-Vision-Automatic-Tracking.txt" gives general information relative to authors, course and contents of the project

--> "Detector-Application-Short.mov" contains very short video showing the application of the alghorithm to a video 
with the bounding box detecting the position of the tennis ball and the confidence level of the detection.

--> "AutomaticBallTracking_Sulejmani_Rossi.pdf" is the PDF file explaining steps of the projects and implementation of the code.
The file is not complete since the training procedure for the creation of the ANN is not present.

Further information relative to the complete NN creation and training procedure, extended videos of the results collected,
python codes of the final detector and other information can be asked via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/veton-sulejmani-b05aa3229/
