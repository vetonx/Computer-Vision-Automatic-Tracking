*** Creation of YOLO detector for automatic ball tracking in limited quality tennis videos ***
Machine learning application which aims to create a YOLO Detector for the detection of real time
objects, in particular for the detection of tennis ball in limited quality tennis game videos.
The creation of the Neural Network is obtained through a training procedure using the 
tools of python, Google Colab and OpenCV libraries. 

Contents of the project: 
- image labeling (500-1000 pictures) via labelImg
- creation of the training procedure on Google Colab
- python code running (subdivision in training/testing datasets)
- configuration of yolo-v3 artificial neural network (ANN)
- training of the algorithm in order to obtain the final models
- application of the model to new videos (NOT in training/testing data frames)
